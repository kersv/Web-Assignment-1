  <p>
    The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. </br>
    It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. </br>
    It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. </br>
    Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own. </br>
